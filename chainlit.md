# 🤖 Semantic Kernel MCP Integration

Welcome to the **Semantic Kernel MCP Integration** - a powerful conversational AI application that bridges Microsoft Semantic Kernel with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers!

## 🚀 What can I do?

This AI assistant can help you with various tasks through dynamically connected MCP servers:

- **💬 Natural Conversations**: Chat naturally and I'll understand your intent
- **🔧 Tool Integration**: Access tools from connected MCP servers automatically
- **📊 Data Operations**: Query databases, search documents, browse the web
- **🧠 Smart Reasoning**: Combine multiple tools to solve complex problems
- **📝 Real-time Debugging**: See my thought process and tool usage in real-time

## 🔌 Connected Tools

The available tools depend on which MCP servers are currently connected:

- **SQL MCP**: Database querying and management
- **RAG MCP**: Document search and retrieval
- **Browser MCP**: Web browsing and data extraction
- **Custom MCP Servers**: Any additional tools you've configured

## 💡 Getting Started

Just start chatting! Here are some example queries:

- *"What data is in our database?"*
- *"Search for documents about machine learning"*
- *"Browse the web for current news"*
- *"Help me analyze this data"*

The AI will automatically determine which tools to use and guide you through the process.
